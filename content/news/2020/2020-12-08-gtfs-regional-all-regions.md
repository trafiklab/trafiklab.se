From today our GTFS Regional and NeTEx Regional APIs contain data for all 21 regions in Sweden. Whether it's a
route-planner, analytics tool, or digital signage you're building, our Regional APIs have you covered with high quality
data.

## What now?

While it's fantastic to have this national coverage, we are still working on publication of more static data and better
coverage for realtime data. Check back later for updates on this topic.
