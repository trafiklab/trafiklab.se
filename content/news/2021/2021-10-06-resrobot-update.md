We are now releasing a new version of ResRobot. This version is an incremental update, keeping most things 
the same, but it addresses a couple of bugs and adds some new features. While we try to keep breaking changes to a 
minimum, we could not avoid them this time.

## When will this data be available?

It is available right now as a new API, and both versions will be running for the next six months. After six months, 
we will shut down the old API. 

If you have any more questions, do not hesitate to contact us at info@trafiklab.se, or to open a support issue at
support.trafiklab.se.

Regards, Team Trafiklab
