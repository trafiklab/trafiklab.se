Today we launch our new website, along with new API documentation. We hope you find this new site an improvement. 

## The need for something new

Over time, Trafiklab grew, getting more APIs, more users, and important for this update, more documentation. The old 
website navigation became an obstacle, as users had to dig deep to come to the right documentation page. This also 
led to API endpoints not being discovered, and hampered our ability to add new features such as OpenApi 
documentation. The new website has a clear navigation on two levels, the top bar and a sidebar for documentation 
pages, making it infinitely easier to find and read the documentation.

## Language change

Since Trafiklab is a Swedish website with Swedish data, it was logical to write all website content in Swedish. 
However, as our open data became increasingly popular in neighbouring countries and international companies, the 
language provided a barrier for many users. Automatic translations could not handle technical details, and often 
even broke site functionality.

Therefore, we have now opted to use English as the main language for the documentation. Some parts of the website, 
such as the homepage and news, are still translated in Swedish for our Swedish readers. When using the website in 
Swedish, you will see a warning along with English content on pages which do not have a translation.

## Where do I find my keys?

You can head over to the developer portal at [developer.trafiklab.se](https://developer.trafiklab.se) by clicking the 
"API Keys" button in the top-right corner. Right now, the developer portal is a slimmed-down version of the old website,
but in the future this portal will be replaced with a new one, which will make it easier to create and upgrade API keys,
as well as see your quota usage.

## Roadmap

Trafiklab is never finished. We will continue improving the website and incorporate user feedback over time. However,
before we make any large updates to the website, our focus will shift to a new API-key management platform. Together 
with this new website, the platform should make it easier for users to develop applications and manage API keys, so 
you can spend less time on Trafiklab, and more time developing.

## Questions and feedback

If you have any more questions, do not hesitate to contact us at info@trafiklab.se, or to open an issue at
support.trafiklab.se.

Regards, Team Trafiklab
