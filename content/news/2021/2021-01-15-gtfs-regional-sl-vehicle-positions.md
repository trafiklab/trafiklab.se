In the coming days we will start publishing vehicle positions for SL (Stocksholms lokaltrafik) in the GTFS Regional
dataset. This means that all operators which provide realtime will support both TripUpdates, ServiceAlerts and
VehiclePositions. SL will start publishing through a staged rollout where there number of vehicles with realtime
positions keeps increasing.

## Which vehicles will share their location?

Right now only busses will share their location, but the goal is to publish data for all of SL's vehicles in traffic.

## When will this data be available?

This data will be rolled out in the upcoming weeks.

If you have any more questions, do not hesitate to contact us at info@trafiklab.se, or to open a support issue at
support.trafiklab.se.

Regards, Team Trafiklab
