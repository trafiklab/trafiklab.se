SL has launched **Journey Planner v2**, which will fully replace **Route Planner 3.1**. The 3.1 service will be shut down on **June 30, 2025**, and
all users must transition to the new API before this date to ensure uninterrupted service.

This change is part of SLâ€™s ongoing efforts to modernize its route-planning service, and is required as SL is replacing the underlying
route-planner.
This change is expected to be the last one after a period of frequent changes. The journey planner 3.1 API offers more flexibility through various parameters,
which allows end users to either recreate the same results as the official SL app, or to adjust the results to their own needs.

SL does no longer require API keys for this API. This means you can start using it straight away, without creating an API key first.

The full documentation for this new API is available [on Trafiklab](https://www.trafiklab.se/api/our-apis/sl/journey-planner-2/). If you have any questions,
please reach out to us [through our support forum](https://support.trafiklab.se).
