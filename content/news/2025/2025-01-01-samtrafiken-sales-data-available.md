A new dataset has been added to Trafiklab. This dataset, [Samtrafiken Sales data](/api/netex-datasets/samtrafiken-sales-data/), is a dataset in the NeTEx format
containing all traffic which can be sold through the Samtrafiken Access platform. This data is identical to the one used by for example SJ to sell tickets over
multiple operators. Note that this data is only the scheduled data - pricing and actual sales are made through the OSDM API which is part of the Samtrafiken
Access platform, for which an agreement must be signed.

Both the latest file and historical data starting January 1st, 2025 are available for download using a free API key, which can be obtained by registering on
developer.trafiklab.se. More information regarding the dataset and its contents can be found
on [the datasets documentation page](/api/netex-datasets/samtrafiken-sales-data/).
