## How GTFS works

A GTFS File is a zip file containing multiple text files. Every text file contains all data for one specific data type
(stops, routes, ...) as comma-separated values. These files can be compared to a table in a database, with _foreign
keys_ linking these files together.

{{% info %}} A GTFS archive forms a database-like structure with every file as one table, and you can import
these CSV files directly into a new database to run queries on them. One example is
the [csv2db](https://csv2db.github.io/) tool, but there are many other ways to achieve this. {{% /info %}}

The GTFS standard defines files which must be present in the dataset, and files which are optional. In this guide we
will only discuss the files which are present in the Trafiklab datasets.

### The general structure

![The GTFS model, as used by Trafiklab. Fields which are always present are marked in bold.](/media/2020/05/gtfs-static-model.svg)

The GTFS model contains multiple files, which can be required or optional. The fields in these files can be required,
optionally required, or optional. The diagram above shows which fields are used by Trafiklab. The fields which are
always present in a file are marked in bold. The tables marked in green are required by the GTFS standard, the blue ones
are optional files used in the Trafiklab data.

### How it's linked together

Before diving deeper into what each field means, it's important to understand how transport data is described in the 7
required files.

A certain "path" on which public transport vehicles travel, is called a **route** and defined in routes.txt. A **route**
is provided by a public transport **agency** (defined in agencies.txt), and can be serviced one or more times in a
day. Every **trip** on a route is defined in the trips.txt file.

{{% info %}}
**Example**: Let's say there is a route "Stockholm - Skövde - Göteborg". There is a train leaving stockholm at 10:00,
12:00, and 16:00. In this case, we have one route with three trips on that route. {{% /info %}}

The stops which are made during a trip are defined as **stop times** in stop\_times.txt. A **stop time** does not
contain information about the stop itself: it only links a **trip** to a **stop**, and includes some additional
information such as the time of arrival and departure. Stops itself are defined in the stops.txt file, including
information such as their name, location and entrances.

{{% warning %}} Different trips on the same route might make use of different stops. {{% /warning %}}

{{% info %}}
**Example**: Let's say there is a trip on the route "Stockholm - Skövde - Göteborg" leaving at 10:00. The GTFS file
would contain the trip, 3 stops, and 3 stop\_times to link the stops to the trip. {{% /info %}}

## What does each GTFS file contain

{{% warning %}} The content below is based on the official GTFS Specification, developed by the GTFS
community and published
at [https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/).

We modified the version below to describe the feeds published by Trafiklab. Fields and files that are not included in
any Trafiklab feed are not described below. For the latest version or in case of conflict, refer to the official
documentation. {{% /warning %}}

### agency.txt

| Field Name | Type | Present | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `agency_id` | ID | **Always** | Uniquely identifies a transit agency. Note that in some cases, such as when a single agency operates multiple separate services, agencies and brands are distinct. This document uses the term "agency" in place of "brand". A dataset may contain data from multiple agencies. |
| `agency_name` | Text | **Always** | Full name of the transit agency. |
| `agency_url` | URL | **Always** | URL of the transit agency. |
| `agency_timezone` | Timezone | **Always** | Timezone where the transit agency is located. If multiple agencies are specified in the dataset, each has the same `agency_timezone`. |

The following excerpt gives some example values for the different fields.

```text
agency_id,agency_name,agency_url,agency_timezone,agency_lang
141010000000001418,Västtrafik,https://www.resrobot.se/,Europe/Stockholm,sv

141010000452254130,Öresundståg,https://www.resrobot.se/,Europe/Stockholm,sv
```


### routes.txt

| Field Name | Type | Present | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `route_id` | ID | **Always** | Identifies a route. |
| `agency_id` | ID referencing `agency.agency_id` | **Always** | Agency for the specified route. This field is required when the dataset provides data for routes from more than one agency in [agency.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#agency), otherwise it is optional. |
| `route_short_name` | Text | **Conditionally**  | Short name of a route. This will often be a short, abstract identifier like "32", "100X", or "Green" that riders use to identify a route, but which doesn't give any indication of what places the route serves. Either `route_short_name` or `route_long_name` must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate. |
| `route_long_name` | Text | **Conditionally**  | Full name of a route. This name is generally more descriptive than the `route_short_name` and often includes the route's destination or stop. Either `route_short_name` or `route_long_name` must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate. |
| `route_type` | Enum | **Always** | Indicates the type of transportation used on a route.  |
| `route_url` | URL | Optional | URL of a web page about the particular route. Should be different from the `agency.agency_url` value. |

The GTFS standard defines 9 route_types, but all Trafiklab feeds make use
of [extended route types](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/extended-route-types). Check the
feed-specific documentation for examples.

### trips.txt

| Field Name | Type | Present | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `route_id` | ID referencing `routes.route_id` | **Always** | Identifies a route. |
| `service_id` | ID referencing `calendar.service_id` or `calendar_dates.service_id` | **Always** | Identifies a set of dates when service is available for one or more routes. |
| `trip_id` | ID | **Always** | Identifies a trip. |
| `trip_headsign` | Text | Optional | Text that appears on signage identifying the trip's destination to riders. Use this field to distinguish between different patterns of service on the same route. If the headsign changes during a trip, `trip_headsign` can be overridden by specifying values for the `stop_times.stop_headsign`. |
| `trip_short_name` | Text | Optional | Public facing text used to identify the trip to riders, for instance, to identify train numbers for commuter rail trips. If riders do not commonly rely on trip names, leave this field empty. A `trip_short_name` value, if provided, should uniquely identify a trip within a service day; it should not be used for destination names or limited/express designations. |
| `direction_id` | Enum | Optional | Indicates the direction of travel for a trip. This field is not used in routing; it provides a way to separate trips by direction when publishing time tables. Valid options are:  `0` - Travel in one direction (e.g. outbound travel). `1` - Travel in the opposite direction (e.g. inbound travel). |
| `shape_id` | ID referencing `shapes.shape_id` | GTFS Regional only | Identifies a geospatial shape describing the vehicle travel path for a trip. |

The following excerpt shows what a trips.txt file can look like:

```text
route_id,service_id,trip_id,trip_headsign,direction_id,shape_id
9011014255000000,1,141010000961947846,,0,1
9011014255000000,1,141010000961947902,,0,1
9011014255000000,1,141010000961947958,,0,1
9011014255000000,1,141010000961948014,,0,1
```

{{% info %}} This example doesn't include a headsign, which means descriptions must be obtained from a higher
lever (route) or lower level (stop time). {{% /info %}}

### stop\_times.txt

A stop time is a certain trip picking up or dropping of passengers at a certain stop, at a certain time.

### stops.txt

| Field Name | Type | Present | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `stop_id` | ID | **Always** | Identifies a stop, station, or station entrance. The term "station entrance" refers to both station entrances and station exits. Stops, stations or station entrances are collectively referred to as locations. Multiple routes may use the same stop. |
| `stop_name` | Text | **Always** | Name of the location. Use a name that people will understand in the local and tourist vernacular. When the location is a boarding area (`location_type=4`), the `stop_name` should contains the name of the boarding area as displayed by the agency. It could be just one letter (like on some European intercity railway stations), or text like “Wheelchair boarding area” (NYC’s Subway) or “Head of short trains” (Paris’ RER).  |
| `stop_lat` | Latitude | **Always** | Latitude of the location. Conditionally Required: <br>• **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`). <br>• Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`). |
| `stop_lon` | Longitude | **Always** | Longitude of the location. Conditionally Required: <br>• **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`). <br>• Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`). |
| `location_type` | Enum | **Always** | Type of the location: <br>• `0` (or blank): **Stop** (or **Platform**). A location where passengers board or disembark from a transit vehicle. Is called a platform when defined within a `parent_station`. <br>• `1`: **Station**. A physical structure or area that contains one or more platform. <br>• `2`: **Entrance/Exit**. A location where passengers can enter or exit a station from the street. If an entrance/exit belongs to multiple stations, it can be linked by pathways to both, but the data provider must pick one of them as parent. |
| `parent_station` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | GTFS Regional only | Defines hierarchy between the differentlocations defined in `stops.txt`. It contains the ID of the parent location, as followed: <br>• **Stop/platform** (`location_type=0`): the `parent_station` field contains the ID of a station. <br>• **Station** (`location_type=1`): this field must be empty. <br>• **Entrance/exit** (`location_type=2`) or **generic node** (`location_type=3`): the `parent_station` field contains the ID of a station (`location_type=1`) |
| `platform_code`| Text | GTFS Regional only | Platform identifier for a platform stop (a stop belonging to a station). |

### calendar.txt

| Field Name | Type | Present | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `service_id` | ID | **Always** | Uniquely identifies a set of dates when service is available for one or more routes. Each `service_id` value can appear at most once in a [calendar.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#calendartxt) file. |
| `monday` | Enum | **Always** | Indicates whether the service operates on all Mondays in the date range specified by the `start_date` and `end_date` fields. Note that exceptions for particular dates may be listed in [calendar\_dates.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#calendar_datestxt). Valid options are:  `1` - Service is available for all Mondays in the date range. `0` - Service is not available for Mondays in the date range. |
| `tuesday` | Enum | **Always** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Tuesdays |
| `wednesday` | Enum | **Always** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Wednesdays |
| `thursday` | Enum | **Always** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Thursdays |
