{{% success %}} You need an account and project in order to retrieve API keys. Haven't created an account
yet? [Get started here](creating-an-account.md).  {{% /success %}}

After creating a project, the last thing which is left is to retrieve API keys for your projects. In order to do this,
head to your personal page, by hovering over your profile name in the top-right corner. Alternatively, you can follow
this link: [https://developer.trafiklab.se/user](https://developer.trafiklab.se/user).

Click on the name of the project which you want to retrieve API keys for, and head to the "API-nycklar" tab. You'll see
a list of all the APIs which you added to the project. They'll look similar to the example below.

Click the purple button to retrieve your API key. After agreeing to the terms and conditions, you will receive an
API-key. You can always come back to the "API-nycklar" tab to view your API keys.

add more APIs or how to upgrade your keys.
