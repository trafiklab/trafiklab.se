{{% warning %}}  Disable browser plugins like Google Translate when creating an project. They are known to
cause issues on the developer portal, when logging in, creating accounts and creating projects. {{% /warning %}}

{{% info %}}  You need an account in order to create projects. Haven't created an account
yet? [Get started here](creating-an-account.md).  {{% /info %}}

After logging in, you can head to [your profile page](https://developer.trafiklab.se/user) to create your first project. In
order to do this, head to your personal page, by hovering over your profile name in the top-right corner and selecting "
profil och project". Hit the purple "Skapa nytt project" and fill in a cool name for your next project.

After entering a name, you can select which APIs you want to use. Don't worry if you're still unsure about which ones
you need - you can change this and other settings later. Projects which will be included get marked in purple.

Enter a short description and some tags for your project, so others can easily find it. Thereafter, you can press the
save button ("spara") to create your project.

{{% info %}}  Only projects with the "lanserat" (launched) status are publicly visible.  {{% /info %}}
