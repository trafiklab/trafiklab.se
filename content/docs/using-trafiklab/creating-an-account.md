Creating an account on Trafiklab is required in order to create projects and API keys.

{{% warning %}}  Disable browser plugins like Google Translate when creating a project. They are known to
cause issues on the developer portal, when logging in, creating accounts and creating projects. {{% /warning %}}

To start, go [the account creation page](https://developer.trafiklab.se/user/register).

{{% info %}} If you have a GitHub account, you can register and login through GitHub. In order to do so, just click
the "Sign up using GitHub" button. {{% /info %}}

You need to fill in a valid mail address and username. This email address will be used to contact you if we make changes
to an API you are using. Your email address will never be made public.

While the first- and last-name fields are required, you use your initials if you want. You can also, optionally, sign up
for the Trafiklab newsletter.

After filling in your information, you need to accept the terms and conditions and confirm you're not a robot.

link you can log in and choose a password.
