{% hint style="danger" %} Disable browser plugins like Google Translate when creating an project. They are known to
cause issues when logging in, creating accounts and creating projects. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %} You need an account in order to create projects. Haven't created an account
yet? [Get started here](creating-an-account.md). {% endhint %}

After logging in, you can head to [your profile page](https://www.trafiklab.se/user) to create your first project. In
order to do this, head to your personal page, by hovering over your profile name in the top-right corner and selecting "
profil och project". Hit the purple "Skapa nytt project" and fill in a cool name for your next project.

After entering a name, you can select which APIs you want to use. Don't worry if you're still unsure about which ones
you need - [you can change this and other settings later](). Projects which will be included get marked in purple.

Enter a short description and some tags for your project, so others can easily find it. Thereafter you can press the
save button \("spara"\) to create your project.

{% hint style="info" %} Only projects with the "lanserat" status are publicly visible. {% endhint %}
