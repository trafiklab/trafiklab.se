All the data on Trafiklab is provided free of charge to anyone who is interested. However, most of the APIs which we
provide cost us money, and therefore we need to keep control over the number of requests to each service.

In order to obtain API keys, you create one or more projects on our website. To do this, you will need an account. The
following pages will guide you through the account creation process and will help you to set up your first project and
obtain API keys.
