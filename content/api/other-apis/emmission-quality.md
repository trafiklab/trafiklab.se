This API was launched during the TravelHack hackathon by the Victoria Institute. It shows the environmental impact 
for different types of transport.

The API has been discontinued, but the data from December 2019 can be downloaded from [Trafiklabs data-dumps Github 
repository](https://github.com/trafiklab/data-dumps/tree/master/2019-12%20EmmissionQuality).
