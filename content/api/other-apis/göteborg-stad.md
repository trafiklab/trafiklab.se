Göteborg's open-data portal contains lots of valuable information, such as reports about air quality, bike-sharing and
traffic noise.

   Open data is information that's available for anyone to use, reuse and share, so that others can develop and create usefulness for even more.
   Göteborgs Stad produces alot of public information about and for the people that lives, visits or runs a business in Göteborg. 
   We want to make this information available, so you can be more involved in the development of the city. 
   Use the information! Build an app, create a website, make an analysis.

The data can be found at [http://goteborg.se/psidata](http://goteborg.se/psidata)
