## What does each GTFS file contain

{{% warning %}} The content below is based on the official GTFS Specification, developed by the GTFS
community and published
at [https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/).

We modified the version below to describe the feeds published by Trafiklab. Fields and files that are not included in
any Trafiklab feed are not described below. For the latest version or in case of conflict, refer to the official
documentation. {{% /warning %}}

* In the tables below, the column 'available in dataset' will be bold if the field is always present and not bold if it

| `agency_id`       | ID            | **All**              | Uniquely identifies a transit agency. Note that in some cases, such as when a single agency operates multiple separate services, agencies and brands are distinct. This document uses the term "agency" in place of "brand". A dataset may contain data from multiple agencies. |
| `agency_name`     | Text          | **All**              | Full name of the transit agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `agency_url`      | URL           | **All**              | URL of the transit agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `agency_timezone` | Timezone      | **All**              | Timezone where the transit agency is located. If multiple agencies are specified in the dataset, each has the same `agency_timezone`.                                                                                                                                           |

| `agency_id`        | ID referencing `agency.agency_id` | **All**              | Agency for the specified route. This field is required when the dataset provides data for routes from more than one agency in [agency.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#agency), otherwise it is optional.                                                                                    |

This will often be a short, abstract identifier like "32", "100X", or "Green" that riders use to identify a route, but which doesn't give any indication of what places the route serves. Either `route_short_name` or `route_long_name` must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate. |
| `route_long_name`  | Text                              | All                  | Full name of a route. This name is generally more descriptive than the `route_short_name` and often includes the route's destination or stop. Either `route_short_name` or `route_long_name` must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate.                                                                    |

| `route_url`        | URL                               | None                 | URL of a web page about the particular route. Should be different from the `agency.agency_url` value. Not used.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `route_desc`       | Text                              | GTFS Regional        | Description of a route that provides useful, quality information. Should not be a duplicate of `route_short_name` or `route_long_name`.                                                                                                                                                                                |

The GTFS standard defines 9 `route_types`, but all Trafiklab feeds make use
of [extended route types](/api/gtfs-datasets/overview/extensions/#extended-route-types). Check the
feed-specific documentation for examples.

{{% info %}} This example doesn't include a headsign, which means descriptions must be obtained from a higher
lever (route) or lower level (stop time). {{% /info %}}

If there are not separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, enter the same value for `arrival_time` and `departure_time`. For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. <br/> <br/> Scheduled stops where the vehicle strictly adheres to the specified arrival and departure times are timepoints. If this stop is not a timepoint, it is recommended to provide an estimated or interpolated time. If this is not available, arrival_time can be left empty. Further, indicate that interpolated times are provided with `timepoint`=`0`. If interpolated times are indicated with `timepoint`=`0`, then time points must be indicated with `timepoint`=`1`. Provide arrival times for all stops that are time points. An arrival time must be specified for the first and the last stop in a trip. |
| `departure_time`      | Time                           | **All**              | Departure time from a specific stop for a specific trip on a route. For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. If there are not separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, enter the same value for `arrival_time` and `departure_time`. See the `arrival_time` description for more details about using timepoints correctly. <br> <br> The `departure_time` field should specify time values whenever possible, including non-binding estimated or interpolated times between timepoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

{{% warning %}} Stop\_times.txt is usually the largest file in a GTFS feed. Depending on the hardware and
programming language, it can be computationally intensive to read all the data. Make sure you read this file in an
efficient way (for example by caching data, not reading the entire file into memory, ...). {{% /warning %}}

| `stop_id`        | ID                             | **All**            | Identifies a stop, station, or station entrance. The term "station entrance" refers to both station entrances and station exits. Stops, stations or station entrances are collectively referred to as locations. Multiple routes may use the same stop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `stop_name`      | Text                           | **All**            | Name of the location. Use a name that people will understand in the local and tourist vernacular. When the location is a boarding area (`location_type=4`), the `stop_name` should contains the name of the boarding area as displayed by the agency. It could be just one letter (like on some European intercity railway stations), or text like “Wheelchair boarding area” (NYC’s Subway) or “Head of short trains” (Paris’ RER).                                                                                                                       |

Conditionally Required: <br>• **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`). <br>• Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `stop_lon`       | Longitude                      | **All**            | Longitude of the location. Conditionally Required: <br>• **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`). <br>• Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `location_type`  | Enum                           | **All**            | Type of the location: <br>• `0` (or blank): **Stop** (or **Platform**). A location where passengers board or disembark from a transit vehicle. Is called a platform when defined within a `parent_station`. <br>• `1`: **Station**. A physical structure or area that contains one or more platform. <br>• `2`: **Entrance/Exit**. A location where passengers can enter or exit a station from the street. If an entrance/exit belongs to multiple stations, it can be linked by pathways to both, but the data provider must pick one of them as parent. |
| `parent_station` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | GTFS Regional only | Defines hierarchy between the differentlocations defined in `stops.txt`. It contains the ID of the parent location, as followed: <br>• **Stop/platform** (`location_type=0`): the `parent_station` field contains the ID of a station. <br>• **Station** (`location_type=1`): this field must be empty. <br>• **Entrance/exit** (`location_type=2`) or **generic node** (`location_type=3`): the `parent_station` field contains the ID of a station (`location_type=1`)                                                                                   |
