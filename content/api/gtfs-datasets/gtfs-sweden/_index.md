GTFS Sweden 3 is a high quality GTFS feed containing most of the public transport data of Sweden. This dataset contains 
high quality detailed data, both static and real-time, in the GTFS format. This dataset is an aggregated dataset of all 
the different datasets in the [GTFS Regional API](/api/gtfs-datasets/gtfs-regional/). There is a single GTFS feed for 
static data. The realtime feeds are, for performance reasons, split up by specific regions or operators. 

## What does this dataset contain?
At the moment this dataset does not contain all of the public transport data of Sweden.
If that is what you are looking for we recommend [GTFS Sverige 2](/api/gtfs-datasets/gtfs-sverige-2/), which is less 
detailed but does contain all of the public transport data of Sweden.

### Data format
The data is in the GTFS format, and makes use of the GTFS Extensions. Realtime data follows the 
GTFS-Realtime(GTFS-RT) standard, and is stored in the protobuf format. This data is also available in the NeTEx format. 
For the NeTEx format, see the [NeTEx Sweden API](/api/netex-datasets/netex-sweden/).

### Updates
The static data in this dataset is updated on a daily basis. The real-time data receives multiple updates 
per minute, see [realtime data](#realtime-data) for more information.

### Operators covered by this dataset
{{% include "/headless/stip-data-availability.md" %}}

### Breaking changes
These datasets have the **stable** status. This means that we will communicate when fields are 
added, or changed. When breaking changes are made, you will get three months or more to update your implementations.

## Static data
The static GTFS Sweden 3 dataset contains files describing all planned public transport data. It can be combined
with optional realtime data available in the GTFS Sweden Realtime data API.
The data in this dataset is updated on a daily basis, typically between 05:00 and 06:00.

In order to retrieve the static data you need an API key. Technical details for fetching the data can be found in the
API's OpenAPI specification. Trafiklabs GTFS documentation can help you to get started with GTFS files.

| Bronze |            10            |           50            |

### Stop Areas

The files `stop_areas.txt` and `areas.txt` files are available since February 11th, 2025. These files are only present in GTFS Sweden 3 and contain a mapping
between stops and so-called "Rikshållplatser", national (groups of) stops which are used in many older systems. Each rikshållplats is represented as an area,
and can contain one or more stops. For example nearby bus and train stations are often combined into one Rikshållplats. These IDs match with ids in GTFS Sverige
2 and Resrobot, making it easier to combine different datasets.

### GTFS Extensions

The extensions are the same as in [the GTFS Regional API](/api/gtfs-datasets/#gtfs-extensions).

### Notes and known issues

The same notes and known issues as for [the GTFS Regional API](/api/gtfs-datasets/gtfs-regional/#notes-and-known-issues) apply.

Additionally, not all routes can however be classified in the same level of detail depending on their data source, which 
leads to some routes using more specific `route_type` values, while other routes still
may use the more generic `route_type` 100. Routes may change to a more specific route type without prior warning.

## Realtime data 
The realtime GTFS Sweden data consists of data feeds describing disturbances, deviations, delays, and even realtime
GPS vehicle positions, separated per region or operator just like the GTFS Regional API (for performance reasons).
It should be combined with static data available in the GTFS Sweden 3 API.

In order to retrieve the data you need an API key. Technical details for fetching the data can be found in the
API's OpenAPI specification. Trafiklabs GTFS documentation can help you to get started with GTFS files.

**Availability of regional data** differs per operator. See the [top of this page](#operators-covered-by-this-dataset) to see which data is provided
by the operator(s) you are interested in.

Replace `{operator}` with the abbreviation of the operator you want to download. These abbreviations can be found in the
OpenAPI specification, but are also listed on [top of this page](#operators-covered-by-this-dataset). Replace `{apikey}` with your own API key.

### Available real-time data

#### ServiceAlerts

Service alerts allow you to get information about disruptions on the transit network. This can be anything from planned
roadworks (a certain stop might not get served for a few days) to electricity outages on a rail network. ServiceAlerts
are broad and general information. ServiceAlerts for GTFS Sweden 3 are updated every 15 seconds.

Read more about service alerts in [the general service alerts documention](../overview/realtime-data.md#servicealerts)

#### TripUpdates

Trip updates contain real-time departure and arrival times for individual trips. This means you can get the current,
estimated delay for each vehicle on each stop. TripUpdates for GTFS Sweden 3 are updated every 15 seconds.

Read more about trip updates in [the general tripupdates documention](../overview/realtime-data.md#tripupdates), 
and check the realtime data column in [the availability table above for availability per operator](#operators-covered-by-this-dataset) 

#### VehiclePositions

The vehiclepositions.pb feed contains the GPS positions for all operators. Depending on the operator, Trafiklab's
vehiclepositions are typically updated every 2 seconds.
Read more about trip updates in [the general vehicle positions documention](../overview/realtime-data.md#vehiclepositions),
and check the vehicle positions column in [the availability table above for availability per operator](#operators-covered-by-this-dataset)

## Extra files
Extra files are files which provide additional information about the information in the GTFS files. They are not part of
the GTFS standard, but contain the information which is needed to link the GTFS files to internal operator systems, or
other data which is delivered by the operator.

The extra file can be fetched by taking the URL to the normal GTFS zip file, and adding \__extra_ in the filename. For
example, the file "sweden.zip" becomes "_sweden\_extra.zip_". These files use the same API key as the static data, and
count against the same quota.

In order to retrieve the static data you need an API key. Technical details for fetching the data can be found in the
API's OpenAPI specification. Trafiklabs GTFS documentation can help you to get started with GTFS files.

### trips\_dated\_vehicle\_journey.txt

This file links every GTFS trip\_id to their source GID in the Noptis data. This file is meant for those who want to
combine or integrate their systems with internal systems of transport agencies. Note that this data is only correct for
operators who deliver data to Samtrafiken in the Noptis DOI or Noptis DII format.

The TransportAuthority-number part of the Gid might not always be correct as a consequence of the aggregation process.
We will update this documentation with further instructions in the future.
