{{% warning %}} **NeTEx files on Trafiklab will be upgraded to version 1.0.15.** <br>
NeTEx version 1.0.11 will be upgraded to version 1.0.15 later this year, most likely in Q4 2025.

Version 1.0.15 includes breaking changes, these breaking changes only require minor adjustments. For example spelling fixes in the enums, such as `WHEECHAIR_ASSISTANCE` now corrected to `WHEELCHAIR_ASSISTANCE`

The stops data API contains detailed data of Sweden's national stops and their mappings to stops from the [GTFS Regional](/api/gtfs-datasets/gtfs-regional/)
and [Netex Regional](/api/netex-datasets/netex-regional/) APIs.

All of Sweden's stops are included in this dataset.

## What does this dataset contain?

This dataset contains all of Sweden's stops in the NeTEx format. There are multiple different KeyValue-elements for each StopPlace and Quay which
contain information that does not fit into any standard Netex elements. Many of these extra KeyValue-elements are mostly useful for operators consuming the
data.

This data is based on the data available in the regional data feeds ([GTFS Regional](/api/gtfs-datasets/gtfs-regional/), [Netex Regional](/api/netex-datasets/netex-regional/)) and enriched by Samtrafiken. If you are interested in the
original data for a specific PTA, please see the regional datasets.

### Data format

The data is in the NeTEx (**Ne**twork and **T**imetable **Ex**change) format. This is a format in which all European
operators have to publish their data. The data is aimed at both operator-to-traveller communication and internal
communication between different organizations. Samtrafiken
follows [the Nordic NeTEx Profile, which is documented by Entur](https://enturas.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUBLIC/pages/728891481/Nordic+NeTEx+Profile).

### KeyValues explained

Most of the KeyValues refer to DataSource IDs. These IDs can currently be transformed to actual datasources/authorities through
the [NeTEx Sweden API](/api/netex-datasets/netex-sweden/)
, by mapping the DataSource IDs to Authority.PrivateCode in the `_shared_data.xml` file. In the future we are going to provide a better way of matching
DataSource IDs to datasources/authorities.

The Keys that are used for mappings all start with the name `local-` and are pipe symbol separated and then colon symbol separated values.
For example a StopPlace with the Key `local-number` with the Value `7:64204|12:7051|74:40|8:64204|100:4` should be interpreted as list of five different values,
where each part is further interpreted by separating by the colon symbol, `7:64204` meaning datasource 7 has local number 64204 for this stop. The table below
explains the meaning of each Key-Value.

"Gid" matches part of the `StopPlace.Id` (or `Quay.Id`) in Netex Regional, as well as the `stop_id` from `stops.txt` in GTFS Regional.

| owner                         | This value indicates which datasource should be considered the owner of this StopPlace and its Quays.<br/>Often this is the county's public authority in which the StopPlace resides. |
