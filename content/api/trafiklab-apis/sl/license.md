## Terms and conditions for SL APIs on Trafiklab.se

### Introduction

Thank you for your interest in the Trafiklab.se API: s. The Trafiklab.se API: s (“ the API: s”) are a collection of API:
s to data on public transportation in Sweden (“ the Provided Data”), collected and compiled by Samtrafiken i Sverige
Aktiebolag (“ Samtrafiken”) and its partners, provided to you by Samtrafiken for the purpose of encouraging the
development of applications, web services and similar developments related to public transportation in Sweden.

Provided that you

1. register an account with Trafiklab.se at www.trafiklab.se;
2. choose the type of API which best fits the purposes of your intended development (for detailed information on the
   technical requirements and limitations of each API type, see the technical documentation provided with each
   respective type of API) ; and
3. accept these Terms and Conditions;

Samtrafiken grants you a licence to the SL APIs in accordance with the following.

### License grant

Subject to the terms and restrictions set forth in these Terms and Conditions, Samtrafiken grants you a worldwide,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable license to the API, for the purpose of accessing, using and publicly
displaying the Provided Data in your application, web server or similar development.

The license is based on the principles of the Creative Commons Attribution-license, and thus allows you to share (copy,
distribute and transmit the work) and remix (i. e. alter, adapt and change the work, including integration with other
information and/or settings), also for commercial purposes, however provided that you attribute the work as specified in
section 4.1 below. Conditions and limitations in addition to the Creative Commons Attribution-license also apply, as
provided in these Terms and Conditions.

Said license, or any development based thereon, shall in no way be construed as a limitation of Samtrafiken’ s and its
original sources’ right to freely utilize, develop or delete the API, the Provided Data or products or services based
thereon.

### Technical requirements

In order to secure the availability and performance of the API and the Provided Data, developments based on the API
shall be constructed in a manner which minimizes the capacity burden of the API. For this purpose, certain technical
requirements and limitations are provided in the technical documentation of each type of API (“ the Technical
Documentation”). The Technical Documentation shall be considered an integral part of these Terms and Conditions and,
thus, by agreeing to accept these Terms and Conditions you agree to observe the limitations set forth in the Technical
Documentation provided for the API of your choice.

Certain technical limitations, such as the number of requests per minute or month, may be improved by reserving a
premium account. The prerequisites, terms and conditions for a premium account are stated in the respective Technical
Documentation. Changes to other technical limitations, such as technical support, are only provided upon specific
agreement with Samtrafiken. Such individual agreements may be discussed and arranged by contacting Samtrafiken at
info@trafiklab.se.

Data requests in excess of or otherwise in breach of the technical limitations provided in the respective Technical
Documentation may be blocked by Samtrafiken, and Samtrafiken reserves the right to terminate such license to the API in
accordance with section 10 below.

### Requirements on use

Applications, web services and similar developments which contain information retrieved via the API shall expressly
state that the product or service is based on information retrieved from Trafiklab.se and, when practicable, a hyperlink
to Trafiklab.se shall be provided.

Unless previously approved in writing by Samtrafiken, the API may not be used for applications, web services or similar
developments which offer users the possibility to purchase tickets for public transportation. The approval of such
functionality may however be discussed and agreed by contacting Samtrafiken at info@trafiklab.se.

As a condition for using and embedding the API into your application, web service or similar development you further
agree that when using the API, you will not:

1. copy Provided Data in order to create your own transcript of the Provided Data (the prohibition against copying does,
   however, not apply to temporary copies for the purpose of caching). Provided Data must always be retrieved via the
   API;
2. assign, transfer or disclose the API key to any third party;
3. interfere with, intercept, disrupt, filter or disable any features of the API or the Provided Data;
4. transmit any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses or any such items of a destructive nature;
5. infringe any third party intellectual property rights;
6. access or use the API or any Provided Data through any technology or means other than those provided through
   Trafiklab.se;
7. use the API or the Provided Data in a manner which directly or indirectly opposes or obstructs the purpose of
   Trafiklab.se and of Samtrafiken, i.e. to increase the lawful use of public transportation in Sweden;
8. use the API or the Provided Data in a manner which in Samtrafiken’ s reasonable opinion disparages, infringes or
   dilutes the name, trademarks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features of Samtrafiken or its
   partners;
9. use the API or the Provided Data in any other manner than as is legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms and
   Conditions.

If you are interested in doing anything different than the foregoing, you must first obtain Samtrafiken’ s written
consent. If you fail to do so Samtrafiken reserves the right to terminate the API in accordance with section 10 below
and, if deemed appropriate by Samtrafiken, to take legal action.

### Provision of the API

The API and the Provided Data are provided on an “ as is” and “ as available” basis, with no warranties whatsoever
regarding its security, reliability, timeliness, availability or performance. Thus, the Technical Documentation does not
contain, and shall not be construed as, any binding commitment that i) the API will at all times meet the service levels
set out therein; ii) the API will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free or that iii) any errors in the Provided
Data will be corrected, and Samtrafiken makes no such warranty or undertaking.

Samtrafiken may, at its sole discretion, change or release subsequent versions of the API: s, the Provided Data, the
Technical Documentation or these Terms and Conditions, and require you to use and comply with the most current version.
If a subsequent version is unacceptable to you, you may cancel the API at any time by deleting the API from your
application, web service or similar development. If you continue to use the API in your application, web service or
similar development you will be deemed to have accepted any updates or modifications. You can always review the most
updated version of these Terms and Conditions and the most updated version of the Technical Documentation
at www.trafiklab.se, or any successor URL that Samtrafiken may designate from time to time.

### Intellectual property

You acknowledge and agree that Samtrafiken and its partners own all legal right, title and interest, including without
limitation all intellectual property rights, to the API and the Provided Data, and that you shall not acquire any right,
title or interest in the API or the Provided data except as set forth in these Terms and Conditions.

For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, Samtrafiken hereby grants to you a non-transferable, non sub-licenseable,
non-exclusive license during the term of these Terms and Conditions to display Samtrafikens trademarks, logotypes and
domain names, in order to advertise that you are using the API. You hereby grant Samtrafiken a non-transferable, non
sub-licenseable, non-exclusive license during the term of these Terms and Conditions to use your trademarks, logotypes
and domain names to advertise that you are using the API. Except as set forth in this section 6, nothing in these Terms
and Conditions shall grant or be deemed to grant one party any right, title or interest in the other party’ s name,
trademarks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features.

### Limitation of liability

You understand and agree that you use the API at your own discretion and risk, and agree that Samtrafiken and its
partners shall not be liable to you for any direct, indirect or any other damages - including but not limited to damages
for loss of data, loss of profits, loss of use or loss of goodwill - resulting from the use or the inability to use the
API.

### Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Samtrafiken and its agents, employees and partners against any third party
claim arising from or otherwise related to your use of the API in violation of these Terms and Conditions, or any other
actions connected with your use of the API or Provided Data, including any liability or expense arising from claims,
losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs or attorney’ s fees of every nature.

### Processing of personal data

You understand and agree that any personal data provided by you to Samtrafiken may be processed by Samtrafiken for the
purpose of administrating, supervising and rendering your use of the API more effective. In such processing, Samtrafiken
is the controller of the personal data in accordance with Personuppgiftslag (1998:204).

You are entitled to information about Samtrafikens processing of your personal data, and to require that any erroneously
processed personal data is corrected, blocked or deleted, by contacting Samtrafiken at info@trafiklab.se.

### Term and termination

The term of these Terms and Conditions shall commence on the date upon which you agree to the Terms and Conditions, and
shall continue in force thereafter unless terminated or changed as provided herein. Either party may terminate these
Terms and Conditions at any time, and Samtrafiken reserves the right to terminate the provision of the API to you with
immediate effect in case you use the API in breach of any of these Terms and Conditions. In addition, Samtrafiken
reserves the right to change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspect of the API or the Provided Data at any time, for
any reason, in which case Samtrafiken will strive to announce such change, suspension or discontinuation within a
reasonable time before its implementation.

Upon the termination of these Terms and Conditions for any reason, all license rights granted herein shall terminate,
and you must immediately cease to use and delete the API, the Provided Data and trademarks of Samtrafiken.

### Miscellaneous

These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and Samtrafiken and govern your use of the API
and the Provided Data, superseding any prior agreements between you and Samtrafiken.

These Terms and Conditions may be assigned by Samtrafiken and will inure to the benefit of Samtrafiken, its assignees
and successors.

The failure of any party to enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver
of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions
as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect.

### Governing law

These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of Sweden, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any
dispute arising from these Terms and Conditions shall be settled in the courts of Sweden, with Stockholm district court
as first instance.
