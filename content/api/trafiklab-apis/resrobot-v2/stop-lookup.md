## What does this API provide?

ResRobot stop lookup provides information about stops, including their ids and position, by searching based on their
name.

{{% warning %}}
**New version available**

A new version, version 2.1, of ResRobot is available. Existing apps should migrate to the new version,
and it is no longer possible to build new apps on version 2.0.

## Using ResRobot Stop lookup

ResRobot Stop lookup takes the search string and the wanted number of results as parameters, and returns a list of
matching stations with their location, name and id. Users can choose between exact matching and approximate matching by
adding a question mark to the end of the search string.

Only the most important parameters and response variables are described on this page. Looking for more technical
details? These can be found in [the OpenAPI specification](api-specification.md).

{{% info %}} Instead of using the station lookup endpoint, you can also use the stops.txt file from GTFS
Sverige 2. This way you can provide autocomplete and other search functions without internet access. It will make your
application more responsive and more reliable as you don't have to wait for API responses.
See [Combining data and APIs](docs/using-trafiklab-data/combining-data/) for more information. {{% /info %}}

**Fuzzy search**

By adding a question mark to the query string, fuzzy matching is used instead of exact matching. This will return
stations which name is an exact or near match to the input string.

{{% info %}} All-caps stations, like GÖTEBORG in the example above, are virtual stations. These are a group
of stations, for example to group stops which are close to eachother or to group several stops serving the same area.
This is especially useful for people who are not familiar with the environment. Instead of having to choose between
several stops which they don't know, they can simply search for trips to "Göteborg". {{% /info %}}
