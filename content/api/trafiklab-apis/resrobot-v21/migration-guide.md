This page collects the differences between version 2.0 and version 2.1 of the ResRobot APIs, so you can swiftly adapt
your application to the updated specification.

## Changes for all endpoints

Users of all API endpoints for which an API key is needed have to do the following:

### Obtaining new API keys

Similar to the previous versions, there are 2 different API keys required to access all features:

- The departure and arrival board API requires a timetables (ResRobot Stolptidtabeller v2.1) API key
- Route-planning and stop lookup requires a route-planning (ResRobot Reseplanerare v2.1) API key

In order to aquire these new keys, you need to add them to your existing projects or create a new project with them. In
order to add them to an existing project, you can follow these steps:

- Login to [the Trafiklab developer portal](https://developer.trafiklab.se)
- Add the new ResRobot API to their project (Redigera project > Add the new API > Spara). For a more detailed
  description, see [adding APIs to a project](/docs/using-trafiklab/adding-apis-to-a-project.md)
- Click "HÃ¤mta nyckel" to obtain the new API key
- If you previously had a key with an upgraded usage level, you can request for the same level. We will approve all
  these requests.

### AccessId instead of key

Across all endpoints, the `key` parameter has been replaced with `accessId`. All requests your application makes should
be updated with this new parameter.

### OperatorURL is no longer available

`OperatorUrl` has been removed from all API responses. Ensure you do not rely on this value in your application.

### Internal ids no longer match public ids

The `id` fields are no longer identical to the `extId` fields. Use `extId` if you were not using this already. Note that
this only affects responses. Names of request parameters are not affected.

### requestId for asynchronous API calls

You can now submit a `requestId` parameter to all API endpoints. The value of this parameter will be included in
the `requestId` field in the response. This makes it easier to handle asynchronous API calls, for example when using
NodeJS.

## Specific changes to the departureBoard and arrivalBoard endpoints

The following specific breaking changes have been made to the departureBoard/arrivalBoard request parameters, along with
the change from `key` to `accessId` described above:

- `maxJourneys` is ignored when making queries in the near past or future, when realtime data is available. We recommend
  using the new `duration` parameter to consistently limit the results list to a specific time window.
- `passlist` is now `0` by default. Set to `1` to keep the responses the same if you need this data.

The following specific changes have been made to the departureBoard/ArrivalBoard responses:

- The `Product` object has been renamed to `ProductAtStop`.
- `Product` is now the name of an array of products, containing one element. Use `ProductAtStop` for consistent results.
- `TransportNumber` is no longer included. Use `ProductAtStop.num` or `ProductAtStop.displayNumber` instead.
- `Type` has a different meaning and different possible values. This field used to indicate the type of the
  departing/arriving journey, but now indicates the type of location for this departure/arrival.

Non-breaking changes:

- JourneyStatus and JourneyDetailRef have been added

## Specific changes to the trips endpoint

The following specific breaking changes have been made to the trips request parameters, other than the change from `key`
to `accessId` described above:

- `passlist` is now `0` by default. Set to `1` to keep the responses the same if you need this data.

The following breaking changes have been made to the trips responses:

- `Product` is now an array of products, containing one element.

Non-breaking changes:

- JourneyStatus and JourneyDetailRef have been added to each `Leg`

## Specific changes to the nearby stops endpoint

No specific breaking changes have been made to the nearby stops request parameters, other than the change from `key`
to `accessId` described above.

The following breaking changes have been made to the nearby stops responses:

- The root object now contains an array of `stopLocationOrCoordLocation` instead of an array of `stopLocation`.
- `stopLocation` can now be found in the items present in the `stopLocationOrCoordLocation` array.
- The `products` field has been replaced with an array of Products. Instead of accessing the sum of all products
  through `products`, you can now obtain all the individual products through `ProductAtStop[].cls`
- `timezoneOffset` has been added to each `StopLocation`.

## Specific changes to the stop lookup endpoint

No specific breaking changes have been made to the nearby stop lookup parameters, other than the change from `key`
to `accessId` described above.

The following breaking changes have been made to the stop lookup responses:

- The root object now contains an array of `stopLocationOrCoordLocation` instead of an array of `stopLocation`.
- `stopLocation` can now be found in the items present in the `stopLocationOrCoordLocation` array.
- The `products` field has been replaced with an array of Products. Instead of accessing the sum of all products
  through `products`, you can now obtain all the individual products through `ProductAtStop[].cls`
- `timezoneOffset` has been added to each `StopLocation`.
